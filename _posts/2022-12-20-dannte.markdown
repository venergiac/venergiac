DANNTe: a case study of a turbo-machinery sensor virtualization under domain shift
* Strazzera, Luca and Gori, Valentina and Veneri, Giacomo *

[Document](/documents/strazzera2022.pdf)

We propose an adversarial learning method to tackle a Domain Adaptation (DA) time series regression task (DANNTe). The regression aims at building a virtual copy of a sensor installed on a gas turbine, to be used in place of the physical sensor which can be missing in certain situations. Our DA approach is to search for a domain-invariant representation of the features. The learner has access to both a labelled source dataset and an unlabeled target dataset (unsupervised DA) and is trained on both, exploiting the minmax game between a task regressor and a domain classifier Neural Networks. Both models share the same feature representation, learnt by a feature extractor. This work is based on the results published by Ganin et al. arXiv:1505.07818; indeed, we present an extension suitable to time series applications. We report a significant improvement in regression performance, compared to the baseline model trained on the source domain only.
