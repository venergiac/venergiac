Developing an agent system through AI is not trivial given the plurality of available frameworks; below is a list of the most widespread ones:

# Building From Scratch

Yes, you can definitely build AI agents from scratch! Below the course:
1. (Build Autonomous AI Agents From Scratch With Python by Udemy)[https://www.udemy.com/course/build-autonomous-ai-agents-from-scratch-with-python]

# Leveraging on LangChain

LangChain, with its impressive 90k GitHub stars, stands as the leading framework for developing LLM-based applications. Its extensive suite of tools and components enables the creation of comprehensive AI solutions using a wide range of LLMs. Central to LangChain's functionality are its agents. These autonomous or semi-autonomous tools can execute tasks, make decisions, and interact with various tools and APIs, marking a significant advancement in automating complex workflows with LLMs.
